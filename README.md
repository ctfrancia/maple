# Maple

## Description

[ENG]
Maple is the backend for the Maple UI. The name "Maple" is a reference to the creator's (me) dog, Maple.

However, this project is aimed at a practical solution for a real-world use case of finding OTB (Over The Board) chess games.

Many time, I've seen that people are using WhatsApp groups to dispurse information about matches in the area that are ranked or casual.
These groups or tournaments are primarily in the region of Catalonia, Spain, but the idea is to create a platform where you can find matches or tournaments that are at clubs, venues or public spaces.

*NOTE*: this will be updated with more language support as it grows and becomes necessary. Also, will be updated with more functionality
